        <li>How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
        <p><br>This is done by the product Owner talking to the stackholders/client. Asking what the users needs are and what they expect to happen in the program will give the team ideas of what needs to be done in the program, and the process of this is called, "user stories".</p>

        <li>How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
        <p><br>The first thing I do is to find what the program is trying to accomplish. Next, what will the program be running on? Does the program need to be scalable i.e., the number of users? Does the program need to be cross-platform? Once I have the idea of these circumstances, than I can proceed with the design and testing. The number one take away from the agile process to me is the product back log, esspecially the one found in microsoft azure boards. This gives the best real time look of the process of the product, what issues need to be addressed and from no matter where you are, this can be accessed from anywhere.</p>

        <br><li>What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
        <p><br>Being a good team member is one that is a team player and one that is open and honest thoughout the production of the product. This can be acchieved though communication thoughout the entire team.</p></li>
